## About These Projects

These projects reflect my personal work on backend pipelines using Node.js and WebSockets. Some projects include private code that I‚Äôve chosen not to share publicly, but I‚Äôve created a public demo to showcase a particular debugging challenge I solved in a text-to-speech pipeline.

They demonstrate my skills in debugging, modular design, improving system reliability, and writing tests to ensure long-term stability.

## Projects

### Private Backend TTS Debug Tool (Private project, source not publicly available)
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, WebSockets  
- Debugged and enhanced a real-time TTS WebSocket pipeline by implementing detailed logging to inspect and verify text payloads.  
- Identified and resolved a critical double-cleaning bug causing failed speech synthesis.
- [See public demo here for debugging the double-cleaning bug.](https://github.com/dangkyle64/tts-debug-tool-demo)

### Backend Pipeline Refactor for AI Text Processing (Private project, source not publicly available)
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, WebSockets  
- Refactored a complex backend processing pipeline to improve modularity and maintainability.  
- Streamlined data flow by decomposing stages and introducing centralized orchestration, enhancing system robustness and debugging efficiency.

### Pipeline Stabilization and Testing Enhancements (Private project, source not publicly available)
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Vitest, WebSockets  
- Cleaned deprecated pipeline code and removed unused files to reduce technical debt.  
- Improved code clarity by renaming variables and relocating functions to logical modules.  
- Implemented defensive error handling to prevent crashes and silent failures.  
- Added comprehensive edge-case and regression tests for robustness.

### Main Backend Pipeline Implementation and Testing (Private project, source not publicly available)
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Vitest, WebSockets
- Developed and stabilized a newly implemented main backend processing pipeline consisting of multiple untested stages. 
- Added detailed logging and defensive error handling to individual pipeline steps to improve reliability and facilitate debugging. 
- Created initial comprehensive tests covering edge cases and regression scenarios to ensure robustness during early development.
